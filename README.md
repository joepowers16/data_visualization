This project uses a directory format that organizes my learning progress in a way
that focusses my time investments and increases the retrievability of my code
and insights.

I have organized the vignette into three folders that reflect my workflow:
In my `daily_log/` I store my efforts in chronological order, just as if they
were being recorded in a paper notebook. The `summaries/` directory will
contain polished summaries and syntheses of my daily efforts. `Exercises/`
includes just that.
